🚀 In just 8 days of building while diving deep into GenAI — I created Axon:
"Think Faster. Create Smarter."
Your AI assistant for instant answers, creative ideas & intelligent conversations.
Key highlights already live:

Multiple LLM models + real-time web search tool calling (RAG-style)
Persistent chat history, pinned chats, saved messages
Full auth (local + Google OAuth)
Syntax-highlighted code blocks + one-click copy & export as snippet
Read-aloud with speed control + multiple voices
Dark/light theme, responsive (mobile + desktop), modular React 19 + Express stack

Built with modern tools: React 19, Tailwind, Passport, Mongoose, streaming responses, prompt engineering, voice synthesis & more.
This isn't a basic clone — it's my accelerated hands-on lab for production-grade LLM apps. Constantly improving (next: voice input + more tools).
Deployment dropping very soon! 🔥
Building Axon taught me more about GenAI integration than months of courses. Grateful for every late-night "it works!" moment.
If you're hiring full-stack devs with real LLM/tool-calling experience — I'd love to share a demo or repo walkthrough. Open to feedback too!

🔥 Option 1: Story-Driven (Recommended)
8 days. 1 idea. Countless late nights.

I built Axon — a full-stack AI-powered chat assistant from scratch.

"Think Faster. Create Smarter."

Here's what makes it special:

🧠 Intelligent Conversations
↳ Multi-model support (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral)
↳ Web search integration via tool calling
↳ Context-aware responses with conversation history

⚡ Developer-Focused Features
↳ Syntax-highlighted code blocks
↳ One-click code snippet creation
↳ Copy code with a single click

🎨 Polished User Experience
↳ Real-time typing animation
↳ Read aloud with speed & voice control
↳ Dark/Light theme toggle
↳ Pin & save important messages
↳ Fully responsive (Desktop + Mobile)

🔐 Production-Ready Architecture
↳ Google OAuth + Local authentication
↳ Modular, scalable codebase
↳ RESTful API design

Tech Stack:
→ Frontend: React 19 • React Router • Tailwind CSS
→ Backend: Express 5 • MongoDB • Passport.js
→ AI: Groq API • Tool Calling • Streaming

The best part?

I built this while learning Generative AI.

No tutorials. No copy-paste. Just documentation, curiosity, and a lot of debugging.

Still improving it daily. Deployment coming soon 🚀

Sometimes the best way to learn is to build something real.

🎯 Option 2: Achievement-Focused
I challenged myself to build a ChatGPT-like app in under 2 weeks.

8 days in, here's Axon 👇

An AI-powered assistant that I built from scratch while learning Generative AI.

✅ What I implemented:

• Multi-model support (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral)
• Web search via tool calling
• Conversation history & context
• Pin, save & organize chats
• Syntax-highlighted code blocks
• One-click code snippets
• Read aloud (with speed + voice options)
• Copy entire AI responses
• Theme toggle (Dark/Light)
• Google OAuth + Email auth
• Fully responsive UI
• Real-time typing animation

✅ Tech I used:

Frontend → React 19, React Router, Tailwind CSS
Backend → Express 5, MongoDB, Mongoose
Auth → Passport.js (Google OAuth + Local)
AI → Groq API, Tool Calling

✅ What I learned:

→ How LLM APIs actually work
→ System prompts & context management
→ Tool calling for web search
→ Building real-time features
→ Full-stack architecture at scale

This isn't just a project.

It's proof that you can learn by building.

Deployment coming soon. Still shipping features daily 🛠️
