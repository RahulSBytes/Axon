🚀 In just 8 days of building while diving deep into GenAI — I created Axon:
"Think Faster. Create Smarter."
Your AI assistant for instant answers, creative ideas & intelligent conversations.
Key highlights already live:

Multiple LLM models + real-time web search tool calling (RAG-style)
Persistent chat history, pinned chats, saved messages
Full auth (local + Google OAuth)
Syntax-highlighted code blocks + one-click copy & export as snippet
Read-aloud with speed control + multiple voices
Dark/light theme, responsive (mobile + desktop), modular React 19 + Express stack

Built with modern tools: React 19, Tailwind, Passport, Mongoose, streaming responses, prompt engineering, voice synthesis & more.
This isn't a basic clone — it's my accelerated hands-on lab for production-grade LLM apps. Constantly improving (next: voice input + more tools).
Deployment dropping very soon! 🔥
Building Axon taught me more about GenAI integration than months of courses. Grateful for every late-night "it works!" moment.
If you're hiring full-stack devs with real LLM/tool-calling experience — I'd love to share a demo or repo walkthrough. Open to feedback too!
